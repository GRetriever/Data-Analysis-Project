# Predictive Modeling for Mushroom Edibility Classification Using Decision Trees


## Goal
- Analyse data to identify its characteristics
- Utilise decision tree to precit the edibility of mushroom
- Identify the most influential factor in the predictive model


## EDA
1. Loading the Data
2. Examining the Columns and Its Types
3. Identifying Missing Values
4. The number of Unique Data Types for Each Column
5. Examining the distribution of each column


## Pre-Processing
1. Data Encoding
2. Spliting the Dataset into Train and Test sets
3. Separating the Dependent Variable and Independent Variables


## Modeling
1. Cross Validation
2. GridSearchCV
3. Training the Model
4. Saving the Files


## Results
1. Feature Importance
2. The Ratio between Poisonous and Edible Mushrooms
3. Submitting


## Ingiths


## Limitations
