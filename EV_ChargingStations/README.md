# Analysis of Highway Electric Vehicle Charging Stations and Site Selection

## Background and Significance
In recent times, the number of electric vehicles has surged sharply, and this is largely attributed to government subsidies. However, concerns have been raised regarding the rapid growth of electric vehicles in the absence of sufficient infrastructure, leading to a variety of issues

The primary issue lies in the availability of electric vehicle charging stations. Charging electric vehicles requires a significant amount of time, even with the recent advancements in high-speed battery chargers. Despite these improvements, the charging speed remains notably slower compared to refueling a traditional gasoline vehicle. Moreover, the limited number of charging stations brings inconvenience for electric vehicle owners, especially in densely populated areas with the limited number of charging infrastructures

The most representative locations are highway rest areas. Despite attracting a large number of people, rest areas inherently have a limited number of charging stations due to their geographical limitations. This limitation fails to adequately meet the current demand for charging electric vehicles. Also considering the increasing pace of electric vehicle adoption, the demand for fast-charging infrastructure is expected to grow further in the future. Therefore, this project aims to examine the current state of electric vehicle charging stations at highway rest areas and explore data-driven approaches to identify the most suitable locations for future installations.
